TIPS:

Add all Admins or any popular users of your Workspace to Collaborators in SlackArchiveBot App Setting. Because bot can crawl all channels they have joined. BUT FOR SECURITY REASON they also access to SLACK API and use OAuth access token to access all messages. SO ONLY ADD COLLABORATORS WHO YOU TRUST !
